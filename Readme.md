2.Change this lines with your redmine url and auto assigne id:

// Default Redmine assigne ID
$config['redmine_assigne_id'] = '69';
```

## Troubleshooting
```
Did not receive a '200 OK' response from remote server.
```
Having this messages in most cases means that Supervisord Monitoring tools does not have direct network access to the Supervisord RPC2 http interface. Check your firewall and network conectivity.

```
Did not receive a '200 OK' response from remote server. (HTTP/1.0 401 Unauthorized)
```
Having `401 Unauthorized` means that you have connection between Supervisord Monitoring tool and Supervisord but the username or password are wrong.

---

```
UNKNOWN_METHOD
```
Having this message means that your supervisord service doesn't have rpc interface enabled (only for v3+ of Supervisord). 
To enable the rpc interface add this lines to the configuration file:

*From the Supervisord Docs*

In the sample config file, there is a section which is named [rpcinterface:supervisor]. By default it looks like the following:

```
[rpcinterface:supervisor]
supervisor.rpcinterface_factory = supervisor.rpcinterface:make_main_rpcinterface
```

The [rpcinterface:supervisor] section must remain in the configuration for the standard setup of supervisor to work properly. 
If you don’t want supervisor to do anything it doesn’t already do out of the box, this is all you need to know about this type of section.

For more information go to the offitial Supervisord Configuration Docs:
http://supervisord.org/configuration.html#rpcinterface-x-section-settings

---

```
The requested URL /control/ ... was not found on this server.
```

If you are getting this error on every action (stop, start, restart etc) most probably your web server isn't respecting the .htaccess file found in `public_html` directory. 
To test this you can add `AllowOverride All` config to the httpd.conf (if you are using Apache) or to add the rules from the .htaccess file to the httpd.conf file.
